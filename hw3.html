<h1>CS267 Assignment 3: Parallelize Knapsack</h1>
<h2>Due Tuesday, April 2nd at 11:59pm</h2>


<h2>Overview</h2>

    <p>The purpose of this assignment is introduction to programming in 
    Partitioned Global Address Space (PGAS) languages. You need to parallelize a solution of the 0-1 knapsack problem.
    </p>

    <p>
    You have <tt>N</tt> items with 
    <ul>
      <li>positive integer weights {<tt>w[1], ..., w[N]</tt>} and </li>
      <li>positive integer values {<tt>v[1], ..., v[N]</tt>} </li>
    </ul>
    The goal is to find a subset of the items such that
    its total weight does not exceed given bag capacity <tt>C</tt> and 
    its total value is the largest possible.
    </p>

    <p>We consider solving the problem using dynamic programming.
    Define <tt>T[i,j]</tt> to be the maximum value that can be attained with weight &#8804; <tt>i</tt>
    using items {<tt>1, ..., j</tt>}. 
    Then it satisfies the following recurrence relation:

    </p><p></p><center><tt>T[i,j] = max( T[i,j-1], T[i-w[j],j-1]+v[j] ).</tt></center>

    <p>The value of the optimal solution is found at <tt>T[C,N]</tt>. 
    Backtracking over the choices gives the items used in the solution.

<h2>Assignment</h2>

<p>
Implement <tt>knapsack.upc</tt> that solves the 0-1 knapsack problem -- your code must get the correct answer, like the provided serial and parallel (fixed) codes. You must use UPC - the Makefile is designed for the Cray UPC compiler (PrgEnv-cray) but the Berkeley UPC compiler (module load bupc) is also available. Explain your parallelization strategy in your write-up, especially the communication pattern between parallel processors. Run scaling experiments with 1 to 192 cores (1 to 8 nodes) of Hopper (at least test {1,2,3,4,12,24,48,96,192} cores). Your report should include performance plots demonstrating strong scaling (constant global problem size) and weak scaling (constant per-thread problem size). Try different local (per-thread) problem sizes - how do your strong and weak scaling curves change?
</p>

    The supplied (naive) parallel code uses a cyclic layout and
    computes entries corresponding to the same item (<tt>T[:,j]</tt>) in parallel.
    Barrier synchronization is used when proceding to next item. 
    This means a lot of fine-grain communication - the parallel code may run slower than the serial code!
    </p>
    
    <p>Your goal is to get better scaling vs. the serial code. To improve parallel efficiency,
    consider blocking rows and/or columns (of <tt>T</tt>), and using bulk communication and/or pipelined computation.
    Using UPC is a requirement.

    </p><p>You may work in groups of 2 or 3.
