  <h1>CS267 Assignment 0: Describe a Parallel Application</h1>



  <p align="justify">This is a warm-up exercise to summarize the state of 

  current parallel applications. The summaries may help you or

  classmates choose final projects.</p>



  <h2>Due Date: February 2, 2012 11:59:59pm<h2>

  

  <h2>Problem</h2>



  <p align="justify">First, include a brief bio of you, your research interests, 

  and what you'd like to get out of the class.  This will help us 

  form initial assignment groups, and later this will help you 

  find project partners.</p>



  <p align="justify">Examine an application problem for which parallel computing 

  has been used. You may pick a problem from your own research area, 

  somewhere on the web, or elsewhere (so long as it is verifiable). 

  Build a web page briefly describing the application, the use of 

  parallelism, and a frank assessment of its success, weaknesses, 

  and challenges.</p>



  <p align="justify">Some specific details to consider include the following:</p>



  <ul>

    <li>What is the scientific or engineering problem being 

    solved?</li>



    <li>How well did the application achieve its scientific / 

    engineering objective? Are simulation results compared to

    physical results?</li>



    <li>What parallel platform has the application targeted? 

    (distributed vs. shared memory, vector, etc.) What

    tools were used to build the application? (languages, libraries, 

    etc.)</li>



    <li>If the application is run on a major supercomputer, where 

    does that computer rank on the 

    <a href="http://www.top500.org/">Top 500</a> list?</li>



    <li>How well did the application perform? How does this compare 

    to the platform's best possible performance?</li>



    <li>Does the application "scale" to large problems on many 

    processors? If you believe it has not, what bottlenecks

    may have limited its performance?</li>

  </ul>



  <p align="justify">Not all of these details will be available for all 

  applications. You ought to explain what you find noteworthy

  about the application or its implementation.</p>



  <h2><a name="submission" id="submission">Submission</a></h2>



  <p align="justify"><a href="mailto:cs267.sp12@gmail.com">Email</a> 
  the URL at which the GSIs can retrieve your work. If you do not have a stable location, 

  you can mail an archive file (tar, zip, etc) or arrange some other transfer. 

  Submissions in PDF and other electronic formats are also acceptable.

  The submissions will be copied and posted under the class's main page, so do not include information you wish to keep private.

  </p>



  <h2><a name="resources" id="resources">Resources</a></h2>



  <p align="justify">Besides your advisor and 

  <a href="http://www.google.com/">Google</a>, you may want to 

  start looking from</p>



  <ul>

    <li>our local DoE supercomputing center 

    <a href="http://www.nersc.gov">NERSC</a>; and</li>



    <li>the yearly <a href="http://www.supercomp.org/index.php">Supercomputing Conference</a>.</li>

  </ul>
